# Getting Started

## A note before you begin:

This application is primarily serverless. [10 packaged functions](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/earth-dashboard-ds/tree/master/AWSLambda) (AWS Lambda) are located on AWS.

* 7 lambda functions are accessible via AWS API Gateway. These [endpoints](#aws-api-gateway-endpoints) return a json string — data that has been formatted, filtered, and wrangled by the DS team (and in cases of dynamic data, placed into the PostgreSQL database).

* The other 3 lambda functions, however, are not accessible via AWS API Gateway. They are functions that are triggered by AWS CloudWatch rules, updating existing tables in the database with new data from various [external API data sources](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc?version=latest). Each day a CloudWatch rule triggers the 3 functions to parse the data from the external APIs, updating the [summary](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/earth-dashboard-ds/blob/master/AWSLambda/summary_db_add/lambda_function.py) (Global Cases visualization) table to get today’s data into the AWS RDS PostgreSQL. As the [bubbles](https://www.planetdata.world/Pandemic/bubbles) visualization rely on these tables, so too does the visualization which updates in order to show relevant data. This is all the result of these self-sufficient functions. Side note: You’ll notice a third table exists in the database (uscounties); this was originally meant to be a dynamic table but it proved too much for both Lambda functions and Heroku.

Why is there a Flask app, then, you ask, if this is all serverless? Why am I necessary?

* There is [1 endpoint](#heroku-endpoints) which could not be made serverless (but go ahead and try with other cloud services such as Google Cloud functions, for example). This exists in the Flask app, deployed to Heroku. The endpoint simply returns the data from the uscounties table in the database for web to visualize the [heatmap](planetdata.world/pandemic/heatmap).

## Prerequisites

    * Flask (preferred: Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-RestPlus, Flask-Marshmallow)
    * SQL, especially for PostgreSQL
    * Knowledge of how to run an application locally
    * Heroku or another web server (if part of the build-on for this project)

## Installing

Go ahead and clone this repository into the directory of your choosing. You'll need to put the [Heroku Environment Variables](#heroku-environment-variables) into a .env file in your base directory.

To start up the app locally, navigate to the FLASK directory via the CLI and type

    flask run

When viewing in your browser, it should result in this:

![Image of Swagger API](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/earth-dashboard-ds/blob/master/Notebooks/Images/swagger_API.png)

Otherwise you may not have the right environment variables.

## Running tests

As only 1 endpoint exists for the Flask API, only a few tests exist for this application, unfortunately. This area should be more robust in a later build.

To run, navigate to the application directory of the repository and type:

    pytest test.py

Or from the FLASK directory of the repository you may type:

    python -m application.test

These tests simply check the [external APIs](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc?version=latest) from which they request a response.

## Deployment to Heroku

Create a new app on [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps). Next, deployment of an application will require creating a special type of git remote called a Heroku remote (a Heroku-hosted remote). You can set this up in your remote repository on github by first logging in to heroku with

    heroku login

Once you have logged in, type

    heroku git:remote -a whatever_you_named_your_app

As the app cannot be run from the root directory of the repository, one MUST use

    git subtree push --prefix FLASK heroku master

in order to let Heroku know where the application is, as it will be looking for the Pipfile. If you renamed your Heroku remote to something besides 'heroku,' replace 'heroku' in the command above with whatever you renamed it.

### AWS Environment Variables
In order to re-create the [AWS Lambda functions](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/earth-dashboard-ds/tree/master/AWSLambda) correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables in each AWS Lambda function.

```
RDS_HOST = database url
RDS_USERNAME = username
RDS_USER_PWD = password
```

In addition, create a Dockerfile based on the Amazon Linux image to create the correct Python environment (we used 3.7). Refer to [this article](https://medium.com/@niklongstone/how-to-build-an-aws-lambda-function-with-python-3-7-the-right-way-21888e2edbe8) for help if need be.

## Heroku Endpoint

		"date": string ("MM/dd/yy")
		},
	"dates": string ("MM/dd/yy")
}
```

### Heroku Environment Variables
In order for the Flask app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables.

create a .env file that includes the following:

```
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql+psycopg2://username:password@databaseurl'
TESTING=True
DEBUG=True
SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False
SQLALCHEMY_ECHO=True
FLASK_APP=application.py
FLASK_ENV=development
```


## Initial Database Migration

You can quickly add a new table to the database and insert a large amount of data via Jupyter notebook in Colab.
